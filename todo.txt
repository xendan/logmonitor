TODO:
- rewrite for regexp groups
- throw error if not match pattern and not start with \t
- support log4j and custom pattern names like in logback


Usability notice
1) Add pattern description directly with keys where to get for log4j and logback.
2) Load example of log file so a) check that your pattern match
3) When create new config - specify that localhost require path to local file (it is visible only from popup)
